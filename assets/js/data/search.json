This piqued my curiosity as I was not aware of cyber security nor what it stands to achieve. “There more I learned the more I wanted to be part of it. It felt like a calling.”I spent the following few months researching the Information security sector and prepared an extensive career roadmap for myself. While I am currently looking to fulfill my short term goal of becoming SOC analyst as a undergraduate, my long term goal is to become cyber security consultant. “There are two steps to success. Understanding one’s path and realizing it.”When I have clear goals, I approach them systematically. What do I need in order to go from point a to b, what is the optimal way, what type of skill set do I need to become successful in that position, what kind of education/certificates are needed, etc.Here lies the crux of this post. What if you do not have prior understanding of what the IT industry looks like? Perhaps you wish to change careers and want to know your possibilities?The goal of this post is to provide a broader visual understanding of the IT industry and its career roadmaps without you having to take the extensive steps that I took. If you have ever wondered how to get to x, y, z positions in the IT industry, I hope this amazing image shared by a Redditor can help you in your journey." } ]
