Cyber Security Analyst | Aspiring Pentester 

```
My name is Reza. Iâ€™m an undergrad student looking to start working on my Bachelor thesis in the coming autumn (2022). I am continuously working on improving my knowledge and skills with sites such as TryHackMe, Overthewire and Udemy.

In the mean time I am looking to break into Cyber Security industry as a SOC analyst. **Why as a SOC analyst? you might ask**. I am naturally very curious individual and I find learning things fascinating.

SOC analyst is a dream job for me because they get to investigate activities, contain and prevent them. Additionally, they audit, implement and manage systems among other things. It is a great career starting point for those wanting get into cyber security.
